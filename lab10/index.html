			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to create a button that calls a function that has a string of text assigned to it.
						The button will then cause another function to run that will take a random chunk of the text and show it to the reader.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When I tried copying the "Waiting on a Wish" lyrics into the function, it formatted it strangely and I had to manually adjust the
						50 or so lines of code onto the one line of the "lyrics" variable so that it would work correctly.
					</thead></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I tried to have a consistent theme for my assignment, changing the variable names, button names, and text color and background
						to all match the song theme as well as the movie "Waiting on a Wish" is from: Snow White. I even looked up different font families to find one
						that would match the fantastical vibe of the Disney movie. I also adjusted the minimum and maximum values of the random generator
						because I realized 5 letters wouldn't be enough for any real meaning since I had actual words in it.
					</p>
