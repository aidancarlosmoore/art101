			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use our newly learned debugging tools and strategies to re-visit any past labs
						we had issues with, and fix our code.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had issues with my Lab 11 code because I couldn't figure out how to get the button to work without using the
						console pop-up window. Luckily, after doing Lab 12 and getting more experience with buttons, I was able to see
						what the issue with my code was. I hadn't edited the function from Lab 7 enough and didn't add an argument to it,
						so when I followed later steps in the assignment and tried to call the function using an argument, it didn't work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Both my lab partner, Chris, and I had issues with Lab 11. With our newly acquired knowledge of buttons in JavaScript
						as well as taking some time between the labs, we were able to come at the problem again and both fix our labs by working together. </p>
