			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge of this lab was to use jQuery and AJAX to generate a random value from an API of our choice.
						We had to make a button that would call this API, and then make scenarios within the function for if the call
						was successful or if it failed.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I reused some code from our in-class discussion of AJAX, but I had to make a lot of adjustments because the
						Pokemon API is formatted as an array of objects, which is different from the format of the "yes or no?" API. I also was confused
						about how to set an endpoint on the Pokemon API and started off with only different Pokedexes rather than the Pokemon themselves,
						but I figured out how to change that later.
					</thead> </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I tried to do this assignment a few days ago and struggled a lot. However, after learning how to use jQuery to implement an API
						in class, it was much more understandable. With my new knowledge, I was able to apply the same process to a differently styled
						API, and still get the random generator to work like I needed it too. My problem-solving in coding has improved. </p>
