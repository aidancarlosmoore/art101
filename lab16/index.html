			<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and APIs</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to use jQuery and AJAX to make a site containing the information from the XKCD API,
						which stores comic book information such as title, release date, cover image, and a transcript. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>First, I noticed that the API site did not have the sections "Tutorial", "Getting Started", etc. like the assignment was saying.
						I chose to pick a random issue number to make a site for the assigment, and got to work on the function, taking inspiration from
						lab 15 and the example function on this lab. However, I noticed that in the console log no matter what I did, it said that I did 
						not have access to the API, so I wasn't able to see if my code was actually working. However, I did follow the instructions from 
						the lab and I don't believe there was any actual errors in my code, so I think it's an API issue. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Whhile I unfortunately was not able to see the actual output of the site due to the privacy restrictions of the API,
						I got practice with writing code for different keys of an API, and also how to combine multiple keys from an API into
						one variable that can be adjusted. </p>
