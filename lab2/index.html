		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
		<p> My name is Aidan Moore. I am a third-year pursuing a double major 
			in Art & Design: Games and Playable Media and Spanish Studies. I am from Irvine, 
			California in Orange County and have lived there my whole life. I'm part Colombian 
			and Mexican on my mom's side and Scottish and British on my dad's side. I have an
			older sister and a twin brother. I have 1 cat currently, Ash, who lives with me on-campus. 
			She's the first cat I've ever had on my own and she's so adorable!! I also put a photo of 
			my cat, Mumsies, who passed away a few months ago. I've always been into 
			video games starting with the Nintendo DS and Wii. I've also owned a 3DS, PS4, PS5, Nintendo 
			Switch, and now I have a gaming laptop. My dream is to one day make RPGs or murder mystery visual
			novels. I would love to develop a Scooby Doo visual novel game with brand-new mysteries written for it. </p>
		<p>
			My partner's name is Chris Lam and he is a first-year AGPM major. </p>
