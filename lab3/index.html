			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to learn how to embed images with HTML,
						embed links with HTML to other sections of a website, create an unordered list,
						and to create new HTML files, some that are sitewide and others specifically 
						within Lab 3.
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Github's servers weren't updating after I pushed to origin, which made
						me think I was doing something wrong, but after checking the local version
						I saw that my changes did work. It simply took a few minutes to update on the
						published Github website. Once I realized that, everything was fairly straightforward
						and I was able to use my knowledge from Lab 2 to complete all the tasks in this lab.
						Also, I didn't know how to link to other HTML files within the same website, which caused
						some confusion at first when I was trying to compile the list of links to the Labs.
						However, after reviewing the lecture and looking at w3schools, I was able to figure it
						out and get all my links working correctly on the Homepage and Lab 3 page.
					</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Thanks to our Chris and I's extra hard work on Lab 2, we already had 
						learned how to do many of the new tasks this lab introduced. 
						So, we were able to expand on that knowledge to make our homepages
						and Lab 3 pages visually interesting with the CSS page. I also learned
						how to link to files within the same website, because in Lab 2 I had only
						linked to images and outside sites. We followed all the assignment
						guidelines, and did the bonus task of styling our homepages, so I think
						we displayed excellent effort on this assignment. </p>
