					<h3>Task 1: Pseudocode an everyday task</h3>
					<pre><code>
					Bake Chocolate Chip Cookies
						Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
						Gather ingredients.
							Pull out sticks of butter to soften.
							Get out 2 large mixing bowls.
							Pull out a carton of eggs.
							Pull out vanilla extract, baking soda, salt, and chocolate chips.
							Pull out white sugar and brown sugar.
							Pull out white flour.
						Combine dry and wet ingredients respectively in their own bowls.
							Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.
							Break eggs into a bowl on their own. Try to pull out any shell pieces.
						Put ingredients into the mixer and let them mix.
							First, put the sticks of butter in and let it mix for a minute.
							Second, add the sugars and let it mix until it has a fluffy texture.
							Third, add the eggs to the mixing bowl one by one, letting them incorporate while the mixer is at a low setting. Add the vanilla extract too.
							Fourth, add the flour, baking soda, and salt slowly, giving it time to mix.
							Finally, add chocolate chips and let them mix in.
						Scoop your cookies onto a cookie sheet, and put them in the oven.
						Check the cookies after 10  minutes and continue to check them until they are a satisfying golden-brown color.
						</pre></code>
					<h3>Task 2: Pseudocode a simple computer game </h3>
					<pre><code>
					Flappy Bird
						Draw the background with pipes coming from the top and bottom of the screen.
							Randomize pipe positions.
						Initialize the bird’s position.
							Place the bird in the center of the screen.
						Draw current screen.
						If the player hits the spacebar, make the bird go up/flap.
						Apply physics to the bird so it will naturally fall down with gravity.
						Make the pipes and ground move to the left as time passes.
						If the bird goes through the space between pipes without touching them, a point is gained.
						If the bird hits a pipe or the floor, the game is over.
							If the player gets game over, they restart back at step 1.
						If the player doesn’t game over, go to step 3.
