// Draw the background with pipes coming from the top and bottom of the screen.
    // Randomize pipe positions.
// Initialize the bird’s position.
    // Place the bird in the center of the screen.
// Draw current screen.
// If the player hits the spacebar, make the bird go up/flap.
// Apply physics to the bird so it will naturally fall down with gravity.
// Make the pipes and ground move to the left as time passes.
// If the bird goes through the space between pipes without touching them, a point is gained.
// If the bird hits a pipe or the floor, the game is over.
    // If the player gets game over, they restart back at step 1.
// If the player doesn’t game over, go to step 3.
