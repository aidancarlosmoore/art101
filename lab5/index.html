					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to teach us how to assign variables in Javascript,
						first within the console of our browser (Google Chrome for me) and then within
						VSCode. We also learned how to link a Javascript file to an HTML file.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I originally had trouble figuring out how to declare a Boolean variable in Javascript,
						 because some sites like W3Schools said I needed to write out the word boolean when
						I was declaring it. However, when I did this in the console, I got error messages.
						I had to declare the boolean variable the same way as the others, with the "let variable_name = variable_value;"
						or in this case "let ownIt = true;", making sure to preserve the lowercase boolean
						value. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> The assignment went well. I decided to base the information on my own
						car which made it more interesting. The example in the Canvas assignment didn't 
						use the "let" format for defining variables, but since the lecture said to use "let"
						I decided to as well, and didn't have any issues. </p>
