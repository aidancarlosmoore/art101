			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to expand on the car data we had from
						Lab 5 and store that in an object. We also had to store all our common
						forms of transportation into an array so that they could be displayed
						on our lab page.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I found that there was strange spacing within the array, not having a space
						after each element, so I added a space to the end of each individual element
						to make it more aesthetic. I also got confused when trying to call the myMainRide
						object in the Google Chrome console, because I didn't realize that the object couldn't
						understand the concatenation I was trying to do. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, this assignment went well for me. I was able to really solidify the knowledge
						of different properties of arrays and objects through experimentation in the console and
						VSCode. </p>
