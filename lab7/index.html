			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to define a function that takes the
						user's name as a string, converts it into an array, removes spaces, 
						sorts it alphabetically, and then returns it back to the user.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I accidentally defined a function as "capitalizated" instead of "capitalized"
						which caused my function to return nothing. However, because I had done the
						console logs after every step of the function, I was able to easily identify
						where the issue was and fix it. I also found that the capital letters
						in the player's name were sorted separately from the lowercase letters,
						so I had to create a new variable to make it all lowercase before splitting
						and sorting it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> I already have a good amount of experience writing functions in Python,
						so the main challenge of this lab for me was learnign the correct formatting
						in JavaScript. Since I understood the lab farily well, I pushed
						myself and did one of the bonus tasks as well, to figure out how sort()
						deals with upper and lower case. 
					</p>
