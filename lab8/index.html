					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab, we had to create an array of numbers as well as a function that executes a math operation. With 
						that function, we had to map it to our array of numbers as well as create an anonymous function and map
						that to our array of numbers too.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When I was trying to figure out how to display the results on my site, I used the document.writeln operation
						but my code still wasn't displaying. I realized that I had forgotten to actually link my JavaScript code to
						to the HTML file. Once I did that, I was able to display all of them correctly. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Now that I'm more familiar with functions in JavaScript, I was able to have more fun with this assignment
						and use some silly (but still descriptive) variable names. I was a bit confused how to get it out of the console
						log and onto the page for tbe bonus task, but I worked at it and was able to figure it out by looking back
						at the code from my previous labs. </p>
