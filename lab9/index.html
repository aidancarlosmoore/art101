			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div id ="Challenge" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to get familiar with jQuery, take advantage of its ability to assign
						multiple aspects in one line rather than having many lines of repetitive code.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div id ="Problems" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>At first, the buttons weren't working because we forgot to actually put an id for each of the buttons in the HTML file. It was
						trying to ask what was only written as a header initially. Also, I struggled a lot on the bonus task but the hints did help
						a lot, especially the parent() function, because it made me realize how I could assign them all at once.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div id ="Reflection" class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a lot of effort into this assignment, figuring out how to make the buttons but also learning how to assign classes
						to the buttons and assign the button click outcome to each of them with only one function. I feel more familiar using
						jQuery in general, as well as doing multiple actions with only one line of code using it. </p>
